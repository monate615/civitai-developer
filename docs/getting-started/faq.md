# Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How do I get my user id?**

**A:** Using your **[API key](/docs/getting-started/setup-profile)**, you can make a request to the following endpoint.

```bash
curl --location 'https://civitai.com/api/v1/me' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>' \
```

**Q: How can I find models that work with the SDK generator?**

**A:** The easiest way is to use the filters on the [models page](https://civitai.com/models). You can select "All Time", "On-site Generation", and "Checkpoint" to get a list of usable models.
